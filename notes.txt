Things to work on:
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- icons for mobile reset filter and back to feature page buttons (maybe reset filter button can be back to filter page button?)
		- change_history
		- dashboard
		- info
		- info_outline
		- place
		- more
	- when filter is on mobile, clicking feature also brings up mobile menu

		
		
		









	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements

	- data sources - will be more (update and formalize google spreadsheet, talk to david, get spreadsheet organized)
	- think about adding small map in feature page on mobile view for spatial context (non-interactive) (can be image)
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
	- merge new data files (shapes) with old ones
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions (i.e. alter southern wi map to accept new parameters)
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, etc.

	- API access - google spreadsheet
	- direct geojson output?
	- shorten the data process
	- make it easier to operate/update
	

	- when finished:
		- comment code
		- documentation for JS file
		- documentation for HTML file
		- documentation for CSS file
		- documentation for performing specific tasks
