Things to work on:
	- change filter to remove everything but what you want
	- change city, town, villages to buttons, from list (add functionality)
	- change hover to change panel information, then back to what was clicked when not hovered
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side)
	- fix search
	- after click search, on exit remove highlight
	- add city, county, town, or village to panel
	- when centering on county, make sure to not block any of the feature
	- change buttons on filter page to custom
	- add styling for urban polygons when clicked and hovered, same as county features (or popup)
	- decide upon fonts
	- no indicator that the currently selected urban polygon is the chosen one
	- distinguish hover, click, and mouseout by LSAD for points and polygons
	- change tooltip to popup (or panel display)
	- comment code
	- documentation for JS file and code
	- check mobile compatability
	- JS code performance updates
		- fix for loop efficiency proble
		- allow for most adaptability possible
	- when going into mobile mode, remove all pullOutPages that are active

	- data sources - will be more
	- maybe have polygon inside the information panel?
	- need milwaukee city polygon (not in sources?)
	- need new urban polygon data (clipped to shoreline)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	- when zooming into urban polygons, changed county style to only outline, or reduce opacity
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future)
