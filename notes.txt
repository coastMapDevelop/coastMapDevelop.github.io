Things to work on:
	- set up references to new google spreadsheet, with new arrays
	- reference GEOID rather than name to not get multiple data in panel
	- must reference and record the rows that are listed in google spreadsheet
	- 5 googlespreadsheet arrays, so have to go through and change / fix where googlespreadsheets are referenced
	- (or just reference all urban panels as one googlespreadsheet array)
	- need more recent census data municipalities
	- Missing polygon data: City of Chicago, City of Waukegan, City of Kenosha
	- No point for Chicago? No entry for Chicago in the Spreadsheet?
	- Just have polygon geometries for counties, cities, and villages. We can keep centroids for townships.
	- Correct unique ID (geoid or other id) to connect geography and spreadsheet
	- Find or create municipal boundaries that are clipped to the shore
	- David working on spreadsheet: Splitting sheets for counties, cities, villages, boroughs, and townships
	- Illinois: subdivisions
	- Michigan: subdivisions
	- Minnesota: subdivisions
	- New York: subdivisions
	- Ohio: subdivisions
	- Pennsylvania: subdivisions
	- Indiana: subdivisions
	- Wisconsin: subdivisons
	- Same county name problem
	- adding townships to full coastal community dataset
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- icons for mobile reset filter and back to feature page buttons (maybe reset filter button can be back to filter page button?)
		- change_history
		- dashboard
		- info
		- info_outline
		- place
		- more
	- when filter is on mobile, clicking feature also brings up mobile menu

		
		
		









	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements

	- data sources - will be more (update and formalize google spreadsheet, talk to david, get spreadsheet organized)
	- think about adding small map in feature page on mobile view for spatial context (non-interactive) (can be image)
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
	- merge new data files (shapes) with old ones
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions (i.e. alter southern wi map to accept new parameters)
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, etc.

	- API access - google spreadsheet
	- direct geojson output?
	- shorten the data process
	- make it easier to operate/update
	

	- when finished:
		- comment code
		- documentation for JS file
		- documentation for HTML file
		- documentation for CSS file
		- documentation for performing specific tasks
