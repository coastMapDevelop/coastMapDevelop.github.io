Things to work on:
	- if counties are toggled off, change color of circle throb, and outlines of circles
	- mobile view - not changing color on click - because color is associated with mousing over and mousing out (toggled for mobile view) - just add color change part to windowChange true for click (or for mouseover - because style resets after you exit a click, and we never mouseover on mobile)









	- when centering on county, make sure to not block any of the features (for smaller view)
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements
	- possible update to dynamic font size

	- data sources - will be more (update and formalize google spreadsheet, talk to david, get spreadsheet organized)
	- think about adding small map in feature page on mobile view for spatial context (non-interactive) (can be image)
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side)
	- need new urban polygon data (clipped to shoreline)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
	- get townships for other coastal states (+ merge and add to full map)
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions (i.e. alter southern wi map to accept new parameters)
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, etc.

	- when finished:
		- comment code
		- documentation for JS file
		- documentation for HTML file
		- documentation for CSS file
		- documentation for performing specific tasks
