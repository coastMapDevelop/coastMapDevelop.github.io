Things to work on:
	- set up references to new google spreadsheet, with new arrays
	- reference GEOID rather than name to not get multiple data in panel
	- must reference and record the rows that are listed in google spreadsheet
	- 5 googlespreadsheet arrays, so have to go through and change / fix where googlespreadsheets are referenced
	- (or just reference all urban panels as one googlespreadsheet array)
	- need more recent census data municipalities
	- county fips code in spreadsheet?
	- Missing polygon data: City of Chicago, City of Waukegan, City of Kenosha
	- No point for Chicago? No entry for Chicago in the Spreadsheet?
	- Just have polygon geometries for counties, cities, and villages. We can keep centroids for townships.
	- Correct unique ID (geoid or other id) to connect geography and spreadsheet
	- Find or create municipal boundaries that are clipped to the shore

	- have to reference new google spreadsheet, update what is inside feature infopanels, update what is filtered, and add new geojson geometry files
		- also add the unique identifier that is basically the join column into the local geojson files
		- attributes needed in geojson: GEOID, NAMELSAD, STATEFP, COUNTYFP, LSAD, filter

	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
