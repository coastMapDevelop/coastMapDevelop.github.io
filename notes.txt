Things to work on:
	- if a feature is filtered out of the map, and you search for it, alert the user that that feature is filtered, give option to reset filter
		or not to. If they choose to reset filter, then run resetFilter() function, and run the zoomSearchedFeature function. If the user
		chooses no, do nothing
	- why does the mouse pointer still change when hovering over a feature that is not there? (look into, maybe not all?)
	- if counties are toggled off, change color of circle throb, and outlines of circles
	










	- mobile view - not changing color on click - because color is associated with mousing over and mousing out (toggled for mobile view)
	- when centering on county, make sure to not block any of the features (for smaller view)
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements
	- possible update to dynamic font size

	- data sources - will be more (update and formalize google spreadsheet, talk to david, get spreadsheet organized)
	- think about adding small map in feature page on mobile view for spatial context (non-interactive) (can be image)
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side)
	- need new urban polygon data (clipped to shoreline)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
	- get townships for other coastal states (+ merge and add to full map)
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions (i.e. alter southern wi map to accept new parameters)
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, etc.

	- when finished:
		- comment code
		- documentation for JS file
		- documentation for HTML file
		- documentation for CSS file
		- documentation for performing specific tasks
