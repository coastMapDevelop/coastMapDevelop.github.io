separate layers by villages, towns, and cities
	- so we don't load in a large mb file and filter for each layer


Things to work on:
	- fonts
	- query click container styling
	- query click features
	- popup styling
	- some kind of top menu with sea grant / NOAA plus extra links
	- layer legend toggle (show + hide)
	- advanced layer legend
	- hover effect on menu icons
	- something is missing - need menu bar on top or left side of screen
	- comments
	- documentation
	- redo code
	- scrollbar on side of screen?
	- check mobile compatability
