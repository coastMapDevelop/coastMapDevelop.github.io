Things to work on:
	- if hovering over the same clicked feature, don't show hovered feature panel
	- when centering on county, make sure to not block any of the features (for smaller view)
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements
	- possible update to dynamic font size

	- data sources - will be more
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side) (meet with Aj and David)
	- maybe have polygon inside the information panel???
	- need milwaukee city polygon (not in sources???) (reason not displaying in search)
	- kenosha city not displaying in search (don't have polygon
	- need new urban polygon data (clipped to shoreline)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	- when zooming into urban polygons, changed county style to only outline, or reduce opacity
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future)
	- get townships for other coastal states
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, 

	- when finished:
		- comment code
		- documentation for JS file
		- documentation for HTML file
		- documentation for CSS file
		- documentation for performing specific tasks
