Things to work on:

	- change zoning to "zoning code"
	- move and change names of resources in feature clicked page and feature hovered page (should just need to change order in filter and feature pages
	- when centering on county, make sure to not block any of the features (for smaller view) (figure out how to setView on center,and a little to the right
	- check mobile compatability (horizontal scroll issue)
	- JS code performance updates
	- check and optimize variable declarations
	- check and optimize function placements
	- possible update to dynamic font size

	- data sources - will be more (update and formalize google spreadsheet, talk to david)
	- think about adding small map in feature page on mobile view for spatial context (non-interactive)
	- move legend to more prominent location (always shown though) (maybe just move to the right side instead of the left side) (meet with Aj and David)
	- need new urban polygon data (clipped to shoreline)
	- AJ suggested mapshaper urban polygon simplification
	
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future)
	- get townships for other coastal states
	- update full coastal view map with southern wisconsin functions
	- more information in panels, pop, growth, change, shoreline miles, people, 

	- when finished:
		- comment code
