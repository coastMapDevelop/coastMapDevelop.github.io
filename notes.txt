Things to work on:
	- set up references to new google spreadsheet, with new arrays
	- reference GEOID rather than name to not get multiple data in panel
	- Just have polygon geometries for counties, cities, and villages. We can keep centroids for townships.
	- Change all array checks and alike to the specific geoid, rather than the name
	- Filter - Burough, Indian Reservation, Township?
	- Search - Burough, Indian Resrvation, Township?
	- Legend - Burough, Indian Resrvation, Township?
	- or break Burough, Indian Resrvation, Township; into Other?
	
	- help with julianne cooper on a project (future) (green bay lake vis)
