  Description:
    Abstract: This map shows political township boundaries of Illinois.
    Purpose:
      The purpose of this map is to show political (voting) townships in Illinois. Information contained in this data set is valid unless there has been re-districting since 1985.

      These data are appropriate for use in regional thematic analysis. The data are not appropriate as a geodetic, legal or engineering base. The data set was not and is not intended as a substitute for surveyed locations, such as can be determined by a registered Public Land Surveyor. Although useful in a GIS as a thematic, reference, or base layer for maps, the data set has no legal basis in the definition of boundaries or property lines.
    Supplemental_Information: This is edition 20040330.  The previous edition was 1.0.  Recent updates:  the data were converted from coverage storage model to SDE storage model.

      Process_Description:
        Source coverage (politown) converted to double precision and reprojected to GCS_NAD83 using Workstation ArcInfo 7.2.1.

        The polygon features were imported into the ISGS SDE enterprise database  following steps outlined in ISGS procedure GISDB_0009.  Some redundant fields were removed.

        Metadata updated.
